# Panash-Plume

Hey everyone! This is a passion project of mine to be able to explore the beauty of the Mongolian landscape. 

I made this game in 72 hours during the Ludum Dare #32 game jam. There's still a lot of issues that need to be addressed though.
I would love help on Animation, Programming, Artwork, and Modeling.

#Aspects that I want to Change:
- add a ravine with a river running down it.
- add more gameplay in the mountains.
- wolves and foxes to be motivated by hunger level and time of day.
- animals should be able to reproduce after a certain duration.
- Moon to be visible just like the Sun is.
- change Sheep Face UI
- better SFX
- more gameplay features for Panash
- Plume flying animation
- carrying Food switches to 3rd person perspective 
- ragdoll animations for animals


Tools that I use:
- Hexels (for the UI)
- MagicaVoxels (for the models)
