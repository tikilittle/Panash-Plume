# Panash-Plume

Hey everyone! This is a passion project of mine to be able to explore the beauty of the Mongolian landscape. 

I made this game in 72 hours during the Ludum Dare #32 game jam. There's still a lot of issues that need to be addressed though.
I would love help on Animation, Programming, Artwork, and Modeling.

Tools that I use:
• Hexels (for the UI)
• MagicaVoxels (for the models)
